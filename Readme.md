# AURORA

## ERC20-Factory

### Create an ERC-20 factory to deploy any ERC-20 token on Aurora. UI for creating the token. This should allow setting all the metadata, name,symbol,decimals. Also total supply and initial owner of the total supply with upgradeability support.

Something similar can be created for NFT.
